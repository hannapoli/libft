# My Libft (Library of reimplemented standard C functions) #

## Part 1: reimplementation of the standard functions: ##

#### Character check: ####

* ft_isalnum - checks for an alphanumeric character. It returns a non-zero value if it’s an alphabetic character, else it returns 0. 
* ft_isalpha - checks for an alphabetic character. It returns a non-zero value if it’s an alphabetic character, else it returns 0. 
* ft_isascii - checks whether c is an ASCII character. It returns a non-zero value if it’s an alphabetic character, else it returns 0.
* ft_isdigit - checks for a digit (0 through 9). It returns a non-zero value if it’s an alphabetic character, else it returns 0. 
* ft_isprint - checks for any printable character including space. It returns a non-zero value if it’s an alphabetic character, else it returns 0. 


#### String manipulation: ####

• ft_strlen - calculates the length of a string.
• ft_strlcpy - (string length copy) copies a string with a specified length.
• ft_strlcat - concatenates (links together) a string with a specified length. It returns the total length: initial length of dst plus the length of src.  
• ft_strchr - (string first character search) returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character in the string or NULL if the character is not found. 
• ft_strrchr - (string last character search) returns a pointer to the last occurrence of  the character c in the string s or NULL if the character is not found.  
• ft_strncmp - (string compare) compares two strings lexicographically. Returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is less than, equal to, or greater than s2 respectively.
• ft_strnstr - locates a substring in a string.
• ft_strdup - (string duplicate) returns a pointer to a duplicated string.
 

#### Memory manipulation: ####

• ft_memset - (memory set) fills a block of memory with a specific value.
• ft_bzero - (byte 0) erases  the  data by writing zeros (bytes  containing '\0') to that area. It is less common and has been substituted by memset on some systems.
• ft_memcpy - (memory copy) copies n bytes from source memory area to destination memory area without their overlapping.
• ft_memmove - (memory move) copies n bytes from source memory area to destination memory area even when they overlap: copying takes place as though the bytes in src are first copied into a temporary array that does not overlap src or dest, and the bytes are then copied from  the  temporary array to dest.
• ft_memchr - (memory first character search) scans  the  initial n bytes of the memory area pointed to by a string for the first instance of a character. 
• ft_memcmp - (memory compare) compares the first n bytes of the memory areas of strings.
 

#### Conversion: ####

* ft_atoi -  converts an ASCII string to an integer.
* ft_tolower - converts to lowercase.
* ft_toupper - converts to uppercase.


#### Memory allocation: ####

* ft_calloc - (continuous allocation) contiguously allocates enough space for objects with defined size of memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. The allocated memory is filled with bytes of value zero.


## Part 2: Non-standard functions: ##

#### String manipulation: ####

* ft_split - splits a string into an array of substrings.
* ft_striteri - (string iteration with index) applies a function to each character in a string with an index.
* ft_strjoin - concatenates strings.
* ft_strmapi - (string mapping) applies a function to each character in a string.
* ft_strtrim - trims the string removing 'set' characters from the beginning and from the end of the string.
* ft_substr - extracts a substring from a string.


#### Conversion: ####

* ft_itoa - (integer to ASCII) converts a number into an ASCII character.


#### Writing to a FD (file descriptor): ####

* putchar_fd - writes a character to a file descriptor.
* putendl_fd - writes a string with a new line to a file descriptor.
putnbr_fd - writes a number to a file descriptor.
* putstr_fd - writes a string to a file descriptor.


## Bonus (Lists manipulation): ##

* ft_lstnew - is designed to create a new node for a singly linked list in C.
* ft_lstadd_front - adds a new node at the beginning of an existing list.
* ft_lstsize - counts the number of nodes in a list.
* ft_lstlast - returns the last node of the list.
* ft_lstadd_back - adds a new node at the end of an existing list.
* ft_lstdelone - is used to delete a single node from a linked list by freeing the memory allocated for the content of the node using a provided 'del function' and then freeing the memory allocated for the node itself.
* ft_lstclear - is used to delete all the nodes from a linked list using the function 'del' and free(3). At the end, the pointer to the list has to be NULL.
* ft_lstiter - iterates over the list and applies the function to the content of every node.
* ft_lstmap -  iterates the list 'lst' and applies the function in the content of every node. Creates a list resulting from the correct and successive application of the function ‘f’ on each node. The function ‘del’ is used to remove the content of a node, if necessary.
